* 2.2.27 release.
New features:
* Composition-based statistics for blastx.
* Added seedtop - a tool for searching for patterns in an input sequence or
  BLAST database.
* Enable remote DELTA-BLAST searches.

Improvements:
* Revamped controls for the number of alignments/descriptions so that they are
  specific to applicable output formats (see user manual for details).
* Reduce memory usage for BLAST searches that involve (large) multiple queries.
* Speed up start-up times for BLAST databases.
* Display of new statistical parameters have been added to the BLAST results.
* Speed up runtime performance of tabular output formatting.
* Improve the placement of gaps in MegaBLAST

Bug fixes:
* Fixed formatting bug when GI input format is provided to blastn.
* Fixed incorrect composition-statistics default for DELTA-BLAST.
* Bug fixes in blast_formatter, blastdbcmd.
* An asterix (stop-codon) in sequence was not rendered properly.

  sequence even if the composition-based statistics were not being used.

January 31, 2012
* 2.2.26 release.
* Mac executables are now Universal Binaries for 32- and 64-bit architectures,
  we no longer produce PPC and Intel Universal binaries. The executable
  archive names remain unchanged.
* Added DELTA-BLAST - a new tool for sensitive protein searches
* Added makeprofiledb - a tool for creating a database for RPS-BLAST

Improvements:
* The blast_formatter application can now format bl2seq RIDs.
* PSI-BLAST can produce archive format, blast_formatter can format that output.
* PSI-BLAST has two new options that work with multiple-sequence alignments:
  ignore_msa_master and msa_master_idx (see BLAST+ manual).
* mkmbindex can now create masked indices from a BLAST database and ASN.1 masking data.
* An improved finite size correction is now used for blastp/blastx/tblastn/rpsblast.
  The FSC is subtracted from the query and database sequence length for the
  calculation of the expect value.  The new FSC results in more accurate expect
  values, especially for alignments with a short query or target sequence.
  Re-enable the old size correction by setting the environment variable OLD_FSC
  to a non-NULL value.
* The blastdbcmd -range parameter now accepts a blank value for the second parameter to signify
  the end of a sequence (e.g., -range "100-")
* There was a performance improvement for long database sequences in results with many matches.

Bug fixes:
* There was a blastn problem if subject_loc and lcase_masking were used together.
* There was a problem with multi-threaded blastx if the query included a long (10,000+) sequence of N's.
* The percent identity calculation was wrong if the best-hit algorithm was used.
* There was a problem with the multiple BLAST database statistics report in XML format.
* Makeblastdb failed to return an error when input was not available.
* The formatting option -outfmt "7 nident" always printed zero.
* The search strategy was not properly saving the -db_soft_mask option.
* An error message was emitted if there was a "<" in the query title.
* A problem reading lower-case masking from the query could cause a search to fail.

  retrieving sequence identifiers.
